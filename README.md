# Objectives
- Understand the role of Cocos National Park (PNC) and Marine Area Bicentenario (AMM) in the protection of highly migratory and commercialy important fish species.

# Time Line (tentative)
- **September 15th, 2023**, Gridded MPAs for DBEM (S)
- **September 15th, 2023**, Run DBEM for sens analysis (J)
- **September 30th 2023**, Results of sensitivity analysis (S+J)
- **September 30th 2023**, Final scenario decission (T+M)
- **October**, Run DBEM for all scenarios and speices (J)
- **November**, Analyse results for scenarios (S+J)
- **November/December**, Write report (S+J)
- **December**,report due date (Hard deadline)

# Outputs
This project is a sub-component of a larger project and will be integrated with a larger report. Specifically we require to provide:
- Results for each scenario and species
- *mini report* with methods, results and description of results

# Methodology

- Develop different scenarios with Taylor and MarViva
- Run a sensitivity analysis to make decission on how to re-distribute fishing effort
- Integrate MPAs into DBEM grid
- Rund the DBEM under the different scenrios and species
- Data analsysis for report

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1 (Conservation inclined)
- PNC, 100% MPA
- AMM, FMSY = 1/2MSY
- Everything else F = MSY

### Scenario 2 (Fishing inclined)
- PNC, 100% MPA original
- AMM, FMSY
- Everything else F = 1.5MSY

### Scenario 3 (IUU inclined)

- PNC, 90% MPA original and expansion
- AMM, FMSY1.5
- Everything else F = 1.5MSY

## Overall details

- **Re-dristribution of F effort**, a sensitivity analysis on re distribution of effort within the PN MPA:
  - Only the perimeter (as in NE Atlantic case)
  - All grid cells of MPA
- ** Getting species list**, ge a list of important species to model, mostly tunas, sharks and billfishes
- ** Understand what is the *F effort* of the region using IATTC parameters and data or literature

## Topics to discuss further
- **Area of study**, How far we are limiting the region
- Do we want a no-mpa scenario?
- Report in English or Spanish?
